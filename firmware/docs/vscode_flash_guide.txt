VSCode Flashing Instructions for Mirror LED Firmware
==================================================

This file documents the working process to flash the ESP32 firmware from VSCode.

1. Prerequisites
----------------
Open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl+`) and install the required tools:

    pip install platformio esptool pyserial

2. Flashing the Firmware
------------------------
Run the auto-flash script which has been configured to work with the VSCode environment:

    python tools/auto_flash_esp32.py

This script will automatically:
- Detect the ESP32 COM port (e.g., COM6).
- Build the firmware using PlatformIO.
- Upload the firmware to the device.

3. Verification
---------------
After flashing, you can verify the connection by running:

    python tools/debug/test_esp32_connection.py

4. Notes
--------
- The script `tools/auto_flash_esp32.py` was modified to use `sys.executable` to ensure it uses the correct Python environment for PlatformIO and esptool calls.
- If auto-detection fails, check the device connection in Windows Device Manager.
